# Macdonald Computer Science Club Website

---

This is the official repository for the MCC website.
Please feel free to add/edit whatever you think is right.

## simple todo stuff
 * Implement dock at the top of the pages, to make navigation between pages easier.
 * the png image for the favicon is too high-quality. Someone change it to a lower resolution. (does this even matter though? oh well, do it any way, lol.)
 * Once we have the official favicon for the website, someone please change it.


## points/scribbles about the website
* should be a news feed on the homepage
* it should host some small files (docs, newsletters, programming stuff)
* command line login for admins
* it should also be fairly modular, so we can add stuff later
* Idk what else?


## Main parts of the website - they will be on the main bar of the website
* title page with the logo and newsfeed
* Downloads page
* Maybe a showcase page where we include projects made by user with a description...
* news page
* info/faq page(s)
* ~~~ adding new pages should be easy


## On post/news
* All posts will have their own file. All posts files will be in a specific Post directory. This will make it easier to add/remove files with command line later on.
* All posts should have some metadata (title, title-image, date) associated with the file. This will allow the program which generates the title page to read and generate the correct title page info.
* Posts should be able to properly display images, text and whatnot.....

### Please give your own input on what the website should have, and correct me if i said something stupid lolol.

### Decide on a style for the website...
