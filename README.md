# Macdonald Computer Science Club Website

---

This is the official repository for the MCC website.

## simple todo stuff
 * Change the favicon in /images/ to something that represents our club. (A logo, once we get it.)


## Main parts of the website - they will be on the main bar of the website
* title page with the logo and newsfeed
* Downloads page
* Maybe a showcase page where we include projects made by user with a description...
* news page
* info/faq page(s)
* ~~~ adding new pages should be easy


## On post/news
* All posts will have their own file. All posts files will be in a specific Post directory. This will make it easier to add/remove files with command line later on.
* All posts should have some metadata (title, title-image, date) associated with the file. This will allow the program which generates the title page to read and generate the correct title page info.
* Posts should be able to properly display images, text and whatnot.....

### Please give your own input on what the website should have, and correct me if i said something stupid lolol.

### Decide on a style for the website...
