## Todo
* Implement a way to edit exhisting posts. I'm tired of editing from phpmyadmin. -Jack
* Set up SFPT and a *Downloads* page.
* Find a way to automatically email/messenger user accounts after a new post has been made.
* Allow users to create a (non-admin) account. This will give them access to Downloads and whatnot.
* FIX THE RESOURCES PAGE!
* Clean up the mess which is our CSS.
* Fix our "security issues".
